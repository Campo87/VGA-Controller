2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk and pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk] -to [get_clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk_1 and pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk_1] -to [get_clocks pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin vga_Sync/FRAME_COUNTER_inst/genblk1_0.DSP48E_BL/CLK is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin vga_Clk/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_vga_pixel_clk, clkfbout_vga_pixel_clk_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin vga_Clk/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk, pixel_clk_o_vga_pixel_clk_1
Related violations: <none>
